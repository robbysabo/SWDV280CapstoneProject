# This mobile application is built with .NET MAUI
* Demonstrates MVVM functionality
* Asyncronously reads JSON data
## The idea is a used car sales shop that wants to display their inventory to a larger audience
* The owner keeps their data stored on a server, requiring the use of REST web services.
* He wants to know that when he uploads more cars, that his app will display results efficiently with no risk of breaking the application.
### My application solves the owner's problem through modern coding practices that are both scalable and performant.
